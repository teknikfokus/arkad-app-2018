# ARKAD mobile application 2018

## 1. Install Node.js

1.  Install HomeBrew: [instructions](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
2.  Run: `brew install node`

This will also install npm.

## 2. Clone repository to your computer

1.  Go to Git projects folder: `cd /path/to/my/git_folder`
2.  Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/careerfairsystems/arkad-app-2018.git`
3.  Go to the root of the cloned repo `cd /path/to/my/git_folder/repo_root`
4.  Install npm: `npm install`

## 3. Run application

You can choose to run the application on either device or phone simulator.

### Run application on device

iOS and Android instructions can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html).

These steps can be quite tricky if you haven't used Xcode or Android Studio before, running the application in a simulator, which is described below, is easier to setup.

### Run application on phone simulator

1.  Install React Native CLI (Command Line Tool): `npm install -g react-native-cli`
    - You might have to run `npm install` again.
    - You should be able to just run `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android` respectively.

If you run into problems the following guides can be useful for [iOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#xcode) and [Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#java-development-kit) respectively. You don't need to read the `Creating a new application` section as this has already been done.

> Tip: Instead of using a virtual device in Android Studio you can use Genymotion, you download it from [here](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/) and you'll also need [this](https://www.genymotion.com/plugins/) plugin.

## 4. Install Watchman (some macOS users only)

Run: `brew install watchman`

## 5. Install Atom

1.  Install [Atom](https://atom.io)
2.  Open Atom and go to Settings/Preferences and select Install in the side menu
3.  Install the following packages: `busy-signal`, `intentions`, `linter`, `linter-eslint`, `linter-ui-default`, `prettier-atom`
4.  Setup `prettier-atom` by changing the following settings:
    - ESLint Integration: `true`
    - Format Files on Save: `true`
    - Single Quotes: `true`
    - Semicolons: `false`

These settings are important to avoid conflicts and to get a common coding structure.

### Now you can start coding! :heart_eyes:

## Parse SVG to React components

1. Open a new terminal in the folder where the SVG-file is located.
2. Run `npx @svgr/cli name-of-file.svg --native -d maps`
3. The parser will parse the SVG-file and place it in a folder maps.
4. To make the component zoomable open the created js-file in your favorite editor and add the following code at the top of your file:

```
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import SvgPanZoom from 'react-native-svg-pan-zoom'

const { width } = Dimensions.get('window')

const zoom = width / 600
```

5. Replace `<Svg viewBox="0 0 600 800" {...props}>` and `</Svg>` with `<SvgPanZoom canvasHeight={800} canvasWidth={600} minScale={0.5} initialZoom={zoom}>` and `</SvgPanZoom>`.
6. Make sure that the SvgPanZoom-component is placed within a `<View>` component with width and height set to 100% (important!).
7. Enjoy!
